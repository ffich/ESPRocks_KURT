# ESPRocks
ESPRocks are Open Source development boards that I designed in collaborartion with Vincenzo Cacciatore. They are based on ESP32 modules designed to help DIY developers to create reliable and flexible home automation systems with ease - with no soldering.

# Kurt
Kurt is a development board designed with an ESP32 module from Espressif that allows connection of any device used in DIY projects without needs for soldering by simply using the set of adapters provided with the board.

In the example you can see a demo project with standard devices and cables that includes:

2 push buttons
PIR sensor
oled display SSD1306
4 relay module
WS2812b 5V led strip
 

Most important ... all devices are connected without any soldering.

# KURT Kit
The KURT Kit includes the full setup to start your project:

- the ESP32 Kurt development board
- the 4 adapters to connect any device to your project
- a set of cables with JST PH2.0 connector

So, out of the box, you will be able to immediately start working on your project and control almost any DIY device available on the market, from relay boards, to displays, to sensors and more.

To check the devices compatible with each adapter take a look at the device table available in the technical documentation.

# Advantages
The main advantages of using Kurt are:

- avoid any connection mistake
- stable connection, with no dupont cables
- no need for soldering connectors for your devices
- no need for soldering more cable to bring power supply to your devices
- selectable power supply (5V, 3.3V) fo your devices
- fast redesign of your project with plug&play devices
- fast code development with code snippets (available for EspHome)
- easy pinout reading on boards and adapters (no need to read datasheet)
- clean design of your project
